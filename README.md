# An-Analysis-of-the-Different-Animal-Outcomes-in-the-Austin-Animal-Shelter-System

## Motivations
The initial goal of my analysis was to examine the treatment of animals who were in the care of the Austin Animal Shelter system. After my intitial explorations returned a lower than average kill rate and higher than average adoption rate, I realized that the Austin Animal Center, excels in this area. I then turned my attention to uncovering hidden patterns within the available data. Are interspecies adoption or euthanization rates different? Or are there other patterns among age, color, or type? I noticed that although there are more dogs (1126) then cats (769) or others (98) the average kill/euthanization/transfer rates for dogs remained lower then the average kill/euthanization/transfer rates for cats and other animals. I believe that a further analysis of this data combined with social science data could reveal a plethora of unconscious biases relating to the feminization and related criminalization of felines. This is a possible future area of research that this data set could be extended into. I also noticed that adoptions peak in the summer. Another future area of research seasonal correlation could be extended into is within the operations or marketing aspects for animal-based businesses. The results of my analysis are provided through this public data.world site as well as on Git.Hub and Jupyter Notebook under "An Analysis of Animal Outcome in the Austin Animal Shelters".

## Build Status
As this was the first time I completed a ml project on GitHub, the project can be built upon with ease. There are several factors to consider for future work - a more comprehensive model, different analysis techniques, or data sets could all lead to new and fascinating findings. 

## Code Style and Tech/Framework Used
The original unprocessed data file can be found at data.autintexas.gov under the file name Austin_Animal_Shelter_Outcomes. It can also be found using its data set identifier 9t4d-g238 or the assigned doi https://doi.org/10.26000/025.000001. Moreover, the original Austin Animal Shelter Data can be downloaded in a variety of formats(csv, csv for excel, tsp for excel, ref, rss, xml). Two additional data files containing processed data can also be found under this domain. The work has been split into two parts. The first is Data Analysis Project Pt 1, and the second is Data Analysis Project Pt 2. 

All files are compatible with Python and were created in version 2.5 of Jupyter Notebook using Python 3 on a MacBook Air.
