# An-Analysis-of-the-Different-Animal-Outcomes-in-the-Austin-Animal-Shelter-System

## Motivations
The initial goal of my analysis was to watch how the Austin Animal Shelters were treating their animals and to ensure that high standards of care were being upheld. After spending time with the data I realized that the Austin shelter system does a better then average job. The shelters have a very low kill rate and a very high adoption rate. There was a correlation between higher adoption rates and younger animals as was expected. So, when going back over my data sets I turned my interest to analyzing what subtle social factors could influence adoption or kill rates. I noticed that although there are more dogs (1126) then cats (769) or others (98) the average kill/euthneization/transfer rates for dogs remained lower then the average kill/euthneization/transfer rates for cats and other animals. This is a possible future area of research that this data set could be extended into. Perhaps if the data from Animal Shelters was combined with data from psychological research studies. I believe that a further analysis of this data combined with social science data could reveal a plethora of unconcious biases. I also noticed that adoptions peak in the summer. Another future area of research that would excell in the business or marketing world for those who run animal-based businesses. The results of my analysis are provided through this public data.world site as well as on Git.Hub and Jupyter Notebook under "An Analysis of Animal Outcome in the Austin Animal Shelters".

## Build Status
As this was the first time I have done a project relating to this line of study and it is my first time using these programs I would say that in the future it could be built to be more in depth and integrative. Perhaps combining more factors and outside data sets. Something to look forward to. 

## Code Style and Tech/Framework Used
The original unprocessed data file can be found at data.autintexas.gov under the file name Austin_Animal_Shelter_Outcomes. It can also be found using its data set identifier 9t4d-g238 or the assigned doi https://doi.org/10.26000/025.000001. Moreover, the original Austin Animal Shelter Data can be downloaded in a variety of formats(csv, csv for excel, tsp for excel, ref, rss, xml). Two additional data files continaing processed data can also be found under this domain. The work has been split into two parts. The first is Data Analysis Project Pt 1, and the second is Data Analysis Project Pt 2. 

All files are compatible with Python and were created in version 2.5 of Jupyter Notebook using Python 3 on a MacBook Air.

## Installation

As mentioned above, for instillation you most likely need a version 3.0 of Python installed on your computer and version 2.5 of Jupyter notebooks.
